<p>Miles Morales returns for the next chapter of the OscarÂ®-winning Spider-Verse saga, an epic adventure that will transport Brooklyn's full-time, friendly neighborhood Spider-Man across the Multiverse to join forces with Gwen Stacy and a new team of Spider-People to face off with a villain more powerful than anything they have ever encountered.</p>
<br>
 
<p>This movie is not just about thye amazing visuals, which of course, it has them, but its a movie about the life of a "common" teenager which a lot of people can relate to, he has his own problems with school, universities and his parents, and all of those problems come from the friendhip. Friendship which gave him his highest moments as we could see on the precuel, Spiderman into the Spiderverse, where Miles build a close reation with the divfeferent spoidermans that came to his universe, among them, Gwen Stacii and Peter Parker, the most relevant ones. But this friendships also gave him hislowest moments, which were when Miles lost his friend. And that is only the idea that the movie gives you since the begining, it gets even better,and the incredible story line accompanied by its incredible animation and soundtrack make an incredible movie</p>

<br>

<p> You have probably already heard that the movie has an incredible animation but why? It's for the style of it, the styles, since the movie does not only follow one, you can see different art styles and different animation techniques during the movie, some of them are really tedious to make, taking some characters to make take 2 years to be animated. But this only bring better results. Each deimeniton shows their own features. In the dimension of Spider Gwen, colors are desplayed in an incredible way, making them represent emotions or which gives room for incredible scenes, both fighting and emotional.</p>

<br>

<p>the end of the movie just makes you wait even more for the next one, the expectations are higher than ever before, the question is if they will be able to reach them.</p>

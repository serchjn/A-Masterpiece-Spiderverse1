<h1>Animation</h1>
<div class="p1">
<p>This movie contains an amazing style of animation with awesome battle scenes. The animators play with both the color palette used in a variety of settings to represent the emotions of the characters and the animation styles. Each character, setting (dimension) has its own unique animation styles.
Some characters took up to 2 years to animate since they were completely animated by hand with drawings </p>

<h1>The Spot</h1>

<div class="p1">
<p> The spot is a comical antagonists. Its even possible to say that he is the comic relief on the tory, but we can see a huge charcater develpment in him for the frustration of just beeing seem like a joke. At the end of the movie he ends up bein a formidable villan. Being worthy of being the nemesis of Miles Morales. </p>

<div class="p2">
<p>We can see him full of spots, he is not a new villain since he has been a spiderman villain for decades since the comics of this one, but the movie brings us a new representation of it. Despite the fact that the spot is supposed to be the main antagonist of the movie, we can appreciate tens if not thousands of other characters that prevent Miles from achieving his goal during the course of the movie</p>

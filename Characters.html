<h1>Characters</h1>

<div class="p1">
<p>The dissign of characters in this movie is amazing, each one having its own personality and design, it even looks like every character was made for a different comic creator, for the different colors, techniques, and qualities that each character has.  </p>

<div class="p2">
<p>Prior to the Spider-War, Hobart had been acting as Spider-Man in his universe for three years. As Spider-Man, he acted as an anarchic activist against fascists, as self-proclaimed performing art pieces as part of his persona as a punk rock artist.<br>Defined by his anarchism and punk-like attitude, Hobart is very openly against authority and organisation. In his home universe, he is openly against the authoritative regimes that plague his world. He is also a performer, combining with his anti-authority personality to perform his self-defined acts of unpermitted political action under the veil of performing arts. Hobart's rebelliousness makes his affiliation with the Spider-Society tenuous at best; when questioned by Miles as to why he's part of the society, he says it's to look out for his drummer.</p>

<div class="p2">
<p>We have seen Gwen Stacy on screen on the last movio of the sipider-verso, but we get a chnace to know her a litte bit more in her own dimention, which has an amazing stle that emphazises on the use of colors to represent emotions.
<br>
<p>During the movie we learn what was the canon event that made Gwen Stacy delelop the most, and we can see a hugue character development during the m,ovie, being that at the beggining of the movie she wanted to keep a distance with miles,. but she seem motiveted and focosed to find him at the end of this one. </p>

<div class="p2">
<p>At this time, everyone knows who is the main character, Miles Morales. In this movie we get to see him animated with dfferent styles trouht the movie, acording to what the scene asks for.</p> 
<p>We can see some paradoxes with the last moive and how Miles uses the skills that Peter showed him on the last movie. This is something really nice since shows the continuity of the character.
